# Remote Control
Control the Zenith Z42P3/Z50P3 Television via Serial

## Background

I recently discovered that [the manual for my television
set](http://www.manualslib.com/manual/485866/Zenith-Z42p3.html?page=51) has a
reference to using the serial port as an "external control device". Everything
the remote control can do can be done via the serial port, which opens up some
interesting automation possibilities.
